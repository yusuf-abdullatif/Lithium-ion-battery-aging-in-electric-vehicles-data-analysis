# Data Science Project

## Overview
This project is part of the 4th Year Data Science curriculum. The goal of the project is to apply data science techniques to solve a real-world problem. The project involves data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and the development of predictive models.

## Objectives
- Collect and preprocess data from various sources.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data.
- Develop and evaluate predictive models.
- Communicate findings through visualizations and reports.

## Project Structure
- `Dataset/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `Data_science_Project/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations.
- `readme.md`: Project overview and instructions.
